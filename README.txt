CChat is a simple chat server network which allows students at small universities to discuss current events and opportunities with other students in their major.

::: Files and Directories :::
README.md                  -This document
GroupRouters.txt           -Stores the encrypted passwords and IP addresses used to run a chat room, passwords and IPs can change at any time.
src/                       -Files which run the chat room network
Central Server.java        -Central server uses GroupRouters.txt to ensure the client enters valid chat room information (group name and password)
ChatServer.java            -Client is connected to ChatServer via GroupRouter, ChatServer is in charge of running the actual chatroom.
ChatRoomGUI.java           -When a client is started on the network an interactive GUI will display the chat room application
ChatServerProcesses.java   -This handles threading for the chat servers
Client.java                -Implementation of the client
Connection.java            -Creates a thread which allows servers to read and write to and from their listening sockets
Crypto.java                -Implements a caesar cypher.
Encryption.java            -Allows us to encrypt new IP addresses and passwords for GroupRouters.txt
GroupRouter.java           -Reroutes client to ChatServer and keeps track of number of clients on each ChatServer
GroupRouterID.java         -Defines the components of a GroupRouter object
GroupRoutersTable.java     -Uses a hashmap to store GroupRouter information (key is group name, value is GroupRouterID object)
ReadClient.java            -Continuously listens for messages from other clients
Server.java                -Abstract class which is used by all server classes to open listening sockets and create separate threads for reading and writing messages
Welcome.java               -This file is also apart of the GUI implementation
WriteClient.java           -Thread which allows clients to write to each other
WrongInfo.java             -Displays GUI if incorrect information is entered


::: How to run this project :::
To test, run (in this order):
1.java Encryption <group name> <group router address> <group router port> <new password>
  -Note: Can be run any number of times to update Group Router information
2.java CentralServer <central server address> <central server port>
3.java GroupRouter <group router address> <group router port>
  -Note: any number of Group Routers can be started as long as the address and port matches that in GroupRouters.txt and a Group Router for that chat is not already running
4.java ChatServer <chat server address> <chat server port> <group router address <group router port>
  -Note: up to 5 Chat Servers can be connected to a specific Group Router
5.java Client

*In order to run the network correctly, it is necessary to hard code the CentralServer IP address in the Client file, when run the CentralServer should not change
